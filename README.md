# Time Series Project

A reproducible R project for modeling and forecasting the French Industrial Production Index (IPI) series. We use **renv** to lock package versions and an RStudio project file to ensure everyone works in the same context.

## Overview

- We chose the IPI series for Building Construction (CVS-CJO, base 100 = 2021).  
- We cleaned and transformed the data, tested for stationarity, and selected an ARIMA(0,1,2) model.  
- We derived one- and two-step forecast intervals and a joint 95% confidence ellipse.
